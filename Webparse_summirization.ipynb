Like all deals and coupons, it is dependent on stock while it lasts or the time before the deal expires.\\nThe\\nCore i9-14900K\\nis a 24-core, 32-thread CPU with eight P-cores and 16 E-cores with a P-Core base that can clock up to 6 GHz and E-Cores clocking up to 4.4 GHz. These Raptor Lake Refresh chips are on the same LGA1700 socket, so they're drop-in compatible with LGA1700 motherboards if you're upgrading from a slower CPU.\\nIntel Core i9-14900K\\n:\\nnow $436 at Amazon\\n(was $619)\\nYou can now grab Intel's flagship Raptor Lake refresh for a slightly lower price, as Amazon has included a $25 discount, making it somewhat attainable.\\nView Deal\\nThe main advantage the Core i9-14900K has over the KF variant is the on-chip graphics. Though many wouldn't need them, it is best to have on-chip graphics for diagnostic purposes if you don't have a spare discrete graphics card, just in case. But if you still prefer the\\nCore i9-14900KF\\n, you are getting a $40 coupon, which will shave off the $436 price tag to $396.\\nImage\\n1\\nof\\n3\\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\\n(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)\\nYou can see how this chip ranks with our in-depth testing in our\\nCPU benchmarks\\nhierarchy, and excerpt of which you can see above. This strong performance is also why this chip ranks on our list of the\\nBest CPUs for Gaming\\n.\\nWe did mention a\\ngood deal\\non the Core i9-13900K for a cent under $400. However, the Core i9-14900K pricing is not so far away, thanks to the discount coupon. Raptor Lake Refresh has previously gained a bad reputation due to a\\nvoltage issue\\naffecting the CPU's instability. However, Intel has since launched\\nmicrocode updates\\nto remedy the problem, so make sure your motherboard is running the latest firmware before plugging it into the Core i9-14900K.\\nWe are working hard to find the best deals for you this Black Friday.
