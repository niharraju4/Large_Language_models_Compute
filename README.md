1. Define LLMs
   -LLMs are subset of DL </br>
   -LLMs and generative AI intersect, and they are both a part of deep learning </br>
   -This is a type of artificial intelligence that can produce new content - including text, images, audio, and synthetic data


   -Large Language Models refer to large, general-purpose language models </br>
    that can be pre-trained and then fine-tuned for specific purposes.


Examples:-  
Imagine training a dog.Often you train your dog basic commands such as sit, come, down, and stay. </br>
These commands are normally sufficient for everyday life and help your dog become a good canine citizen. </br>
Good boy! But, if you need a special-service dog, such as a police dog, a guide dog, or a hunting dog, you  </br>
add special trainings, right? 
   
3. Describe LLM use cases
4. Exp prompt tuning and describe google's gen AI development tools.
